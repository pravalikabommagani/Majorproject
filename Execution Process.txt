Execution Process:
Firstly, we need to consider Gemini Api which contains pre-trained model Bert.
And need to upload images from any online sites or downloaded ones.
Later on, the image that was uploaded was analyzed by the "Bert" pre-trained model and it produces relevant questions by extracting the features required.
The features extracted are analyzed to produce accurate questions and are displayed using Streamlit application for the user interface.
Here, we entirely included all required code files in a folder and the execution process goes on:
we need to open the command of that folder where all code files are available.
And need to install the required Gemini API using the command - pip install google-generativeai
Then we need to have an updated Python version available on the laptop.
We need to run the code App.py using the command - python -m streamlit run App.py which provides user interface that displays the required questions of the image.
